/**
 * @title Truster Vulnerability Demonstration
 * @notice Demonstrates the exploitation of the flash loan mechanism in the TrusterLenderPool contract
 *
 * @dev The vulnerability exists because:
 * - The `flashLoan` function allows executing arbitrary functions on any contract with data provided by the borrower.
 * - This can be used to manipulate contract states or interact with other contracts during the flash loan execution.
 *
 * Attack flow:
 * 1. Attacker contract (e.g., `Target`) calls `flashLoan`, specifying the token contract (`token`) as the target.
 * 2. The call data includes a command to `approve` a large amount of tokens on behalf of `TrusterLenderPool` to the attackerâ€™s address.
 * 3. After the `flashLoan` execution, the attacker can use `transferFrom` to move the approved tokens to their address, effectively "stealing" the tokens.
